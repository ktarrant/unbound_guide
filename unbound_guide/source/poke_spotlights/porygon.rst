Recommendations:

- Ability: Adaptability
    - Adaptability makes STAB moves do 2x damage instead
      of 1.5x damage. Paired with Conversion, Porygon can
      choose which move it wants to have 2x power.
- Nature: Timid (+SpAtk, -Atk)
- Thunderbolt / Ice Beam / Recover / Conversion

STAB Thunderbolt is devastating, Ice Beam gives coverage.
