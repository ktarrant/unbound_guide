Difficulty
-----------------------------------
Some aspects of this game differ depending on the
difficulty level.
I first played through this game at Difficult level,
so certain things may not be available or possible
if you are playing at a higher difficult.
I intend to replay the game on Expert and I will
try to point out known differences between the
difficulties when I see them or when I read about
them online.

Save Prompts
-----------------------------------
I recommend enabling the Save Prompts feature in the
settings which will ask you if you want to save before
major battles. More importantly, the game will ask you
to save before you receive any Pokemon from an NPC,
or before any important catchable Pokemon encounter.
This is very valuable because you can inspect the
received Pokemon, see if it has the correct Nature or
Ability or Gender or IVs that you desire; and if not,
then you can restart your game and load the save and
try again.

My understanding is that if you use Save States,
this does not work the same, since the active seed
of the RNG is reloaded, and therefore you will get
the same exact Pokemon every time.
I haven't tested tested this, but keep that in mind.

Personal Note
-------------------------------------
My first video game obsession was Pokemon.
I grew up overseas and had a jacked up game boy pocket
and played a bootleg cart of Blue version first.
The cart couldn’t save.
The cleaning lady unplugged it once and when
I got back home from school I threw a mega tantrum.
Poor lady lol.
I loved that game but got so frustrated with it.

When I got a proper Game Boy Color and Gold Version,
I played through it like 4 times.
Then I got Crystal version, and played that like 7 times,
discovering new things constantly.

Then I got the Official Strategy Guide for Crystal
at Blockbuster, and realized I missed sooo much.
I loved the guide.
It was comprehensive, pointed out hidden stuff I would
never find, and helped me run through the game at least
a dozen more times.
It kept me excited about the game, by keeping things
manageable and giving me a safety net any time I got
frustrated.
It also had good art and was laid out in a visually
stimulating way.
When I saw the map for a cave I had to tackle,
I didn’t study it intently and spoil the whole thing,
I jumped in and explored feeling safe in the knowledge
that I can refer to it if I get annoyed.
That’s the point of the guide, imo - not to spoil the game,
but to provide help whenever you need it.

That old Crystal guide is the inspiration for this guide.
I want to provide a handy reference to help you remember
the things you forgot, lead you to the things you might
not find, and avoid getting overwhelmed by the breadth
of this great game.
Said another way, I hope this helps you avoid anything
that annoys you, keeps you from missing anything fun,
and helps you achieve your goals! :)
