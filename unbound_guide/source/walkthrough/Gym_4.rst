Path to Gym 4

Looking Forward
===============
The next gym is in Fallshore City and it is the Normal-type Gym.
However, it's gimmick is that it is an Inverse battle area, so
all type matchups are reversed.
A non-Ghost type Pokemon with a Ghost-type move is the best way
to get a Super Effective hit.
A common method is to use Toxic Spikes to apply poison and then use
a Pokemon with Hex to deal bonus damage.
Hex can be taught by an NPC on Route 9.
Nidoqueen or Nidoking is a good way to lay Toxic Spikes.
Skorupi is another option, but will not evolve before this gym.
The nice thing about Nidoqueen is you can evolve her all the way
before this fight.
For Hex, Vulpix (either kind) or Froslass are good options.
Nidoqueen can also learn it via the Move Tutor.
Nidoran can be found on Route 5.


KBT Expressway
==============
You can take the KBT Expressway from Blizzard City.
If you go back to Crater Town, you can take the KBT
Expressway south and then use Rock Smash to reach
Fallshore City.
