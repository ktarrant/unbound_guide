Looking Forward
===============
The next gym is in Dehara City and it is the Electric/Steel-type Gym.
It's gimmick is that all Electric and Steel Pokemon are lifted off the
ground, making them immune to ground moves as well as Spikes and Toxic
Spikes.
Picking up a Magnemite in Thundercap Mt. can be useful for that gym,
as it benefits from the gimmick and is very tanky.
Seems like Torkoal may be a good option too?
