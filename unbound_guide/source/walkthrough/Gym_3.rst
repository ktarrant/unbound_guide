Path to Gym 3
*************

Looking Forward
===============
The third gym is in Blizzard City and uses Flying types.
More importantly, in Blizzard City you can get the DexNav.
The DexNav is critical for getting strong Pokemon.
Once you have the DexNav, it's recommended to go to Route 7
and catch a bunch of Abra to use for Synchronize.
From there you can start using the DexNav with a Sync pokemon
to get strong Wild Pokemon with the correct nature.
Getting a Torkoal or two to train up on the journey to Blizzard
Town will also be very useful since he can tank the attacks of
the fast Flying types in the Blizzard Gym.

Battle with Zeph
================
As soon as you head south from Crater Town, you will be ambushed.
This ends up being kind of a tough battle, I decided to train up before it.
Like the last enemy, they are very fast.
So you may need to get someone beefy who can survive to land a return hit.
Once you beat him, you will end up in the KBT Expressway and get Cut.

Cut Locations
===================
Now that we have cut, a few previous locations are now accessible.
TM112 - Round
    Near Grim Woods exit, Route 4

Valley Cave
===========
Pretty straightforward, there is a Chansey to heal at the exit.

Pokemon Spotlight: Gligar
-------------------------
Gligar is a good Pokemon Catcher, being able to learn False Swipe and Thief.
Gligar also becomes Gliscor, which can be a very strong Pokemon.
If you can get one with the hidden ability Poison Heal, you can use it
in conjunction with a Toxic Orb to give Gliscor strong passive heal.
Along with Roost, Gliscor can have strong sustain. It also can learn
Swords Dance and Earthquake to make it a powerful sweeper.

Route 6
=======

You will have an option to go south to see the shore of Auburn Waterway.
Recommend ignore this for now.

TM95 Struggle Bug is in between the ledges east of the Sun Trio.

Route 7
=======

There is a nice lady that will heal your party at the end of Route 7,
i.e. at the beginning of Frost Mountain.

Pokemon Spotlight: Abra
-----------------------
Abra is the first Pokemon you can obtain easily with the Synchronize ability.
This can be used to get the natures you want from wild and gifted Pokemon.
It's highly recommended you go get the DexNav first, and then catch an
Abra with Synchronize ability with every important Nature.
Jolly, Adamant, Modest, and Timid are most important.
Impish, Careful, Calm, Bold are second most important.

Blizzard City
=============

PokeMart
--------
The PokeMart sells TMs here:
TM34 - Shock Wave
TM39 - Rock Tomb
TM55 - Brine
TM63 - Venoshock
TM78 - Low Sweep
TM96 - Bulldoze
TM88 - Pluck

Electrode Trade
---------------
A little girl will give you an Electrode for an Onix.
The Spotlight is below, but at this poin

Aurora Veil
-----------
Someone in town will gift you Aurora Veil.
It's hard to get Hail at this point, the best way
that I can see is with a Vanillite.

Pokemon Spotlight: Electrode
----------------------------

Setup Guy
^^^^^^^^^
- Ability: Aftermath
    - Allows Electrode to cause some damage after it finishes
      doing its setup.
- Nature: Jolly or Timid
    - Electrode needs as much as speed as possible to ensure
      it has time to do at least one of its setup moves.
- EVs: 252 HP, 4 Atk, 252 Spe
- Moves:
    - Reflect
    - Light Screen
    - Taunt
    - Explosion / Volt Switch
Item: Light Clay

Electrode can use Taunt to prevent the enemy from using
status moves to setup, and then can use Reflect and
Light Screen to setup for your team's sweepers.
Use Light Clay to extend the duration of Reflect and
Light Screen to 8 turns.

Rain Setter
^^^^^^^^^^^
- Ability: Soundproof
- Nature: Timid
- EVs: 252 HP, 4 Atk, 252 Spe
- Moves:
    - Rain Dance
    - Taunt
    - Thunder
    - Explosion
Item: Damp Rock

Electrode can learn Rain Dance and Thunder making him
a good setter for Rain teams. Use Damp Rock to extend
the duration of Rain Dance to 8 turns.

Gym 3: Fly Boy
--------------
Oh look, another speed freak.
The gimmick of this gym is that Flying types are faster.
Gligar is the big electricity counter, but he is 4x weak to ice.
Someone also kindly gifts you Aurora Veil in Blizzard City.
However, Pinsir's brick break counters it easily.
The Minior sets up Stealth Rock.
The Mega Pinsir can deal fighting hits that counter Steel and Normal.
The Gliscor may the toughest, immune to Electricity,
and STAB Bulldozer hits hard.
Gliscor also has huge Defense, so Special Attackers are better.

Ultimately a beat this gym by using two Torkoal, Clefable,
Swanna, Electrode, and Gabite with Eviolite.
The Torkoal and Clefable were absolutely critical.
