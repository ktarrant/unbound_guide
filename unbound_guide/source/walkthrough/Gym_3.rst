Path to Gym 3
*************

Looking Forward
===============
The third gym is in Blizzard City and uses Flying types.
More importantly, in Blizzard City you can get the DexNav.
The DexNav is critical for getting strong Pokemon.
Once you have the DexNav, it's recommended to go to Route 7
and catch a bunch of Abra.

Battle with Zeph
================
As soon as you head south from Crater Town, you will be ambushed.
This ends up being kind of a tough battle, I decided to train up before it.
Once you beat him, you will end up in the KBT Expressway and get Cut.

Cut Locations
===================
Now that we have cut, a few previous locations are now accessible.
TM112 - Round
    Near Grim Woods exit, Route 4

Valley Cave
===========
Pretty straightforward, there is a Chansey to heal at the exit.

Route 6
=======

You will have an option to go south to see the shore of Auburn Waterway.
Recommend ignore this for now.

Route 7
=======

There is a nice lady that will heal your party at the end of Route 7,
i.e. at the beginning of Frost Mountain.

Pokemon Spotlight: Abra
-----------------------
Abra is the first Pokemon you can obtain easily with the Synchronize ability.
This can be used to get the natures you want from wild and gifted Pokemon.
It's highly recommended you go get the DexNav first, and then catch an
Abra with Synchronize ability with every important Nature.
Jolly, Adamant, Modest, and Timid are most important.
Impish, Careful, Calm, Bold are second most important.
