Path to Gym 3

Looking Forward
===============
The first gym is in Blizzard City and uses Grass and Fairy types.
Poison is super effective against both types.
Fire, Ice, Flying, and Steel are also effective.
Water, Ground, Rock, Ice, Dragon, and Dark will be vulnerable.

Battle with Zeph
================
As soon as you head south from Crater Town, you will be ambushed.
This ends up being kind of a tough battle, I decided to train up before it.
Once you beat him, you will end up in the KBT Expressway and get Cut.
