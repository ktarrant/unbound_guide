Path to Gym 1
*************

Looking Forward
===============
The first gym is in Dresco Town and uses Grass and Fairy types.
Poison is super effective against both types.
Fire, Ice, Flying, and Steel are also effective.
Water, Ground, Rock, Ice, Dragon, and Dark will be vulnerable.

Route 1
=======

Icicle Cave
===========

Pokemon Spotlight: Zubat
------------------------
Zubat has been a bastion of the early game since Gen 1.
Zubat's strongest stat is its Speed, but beyond that is adaptable.
Zubat can use Toxic to badly poison foes, and U-Turn to escape after
poisoning the foe.
An Attack Zubat can use Cross Poison and Aeriel Ace to do damage.
Aeriel Ace can be especially useful for the first gym.
A Special Attack Zubat can rely on Venoshock on a poisoned target,
and Air Cutter.
In the early game, without a DexNav, you will want to be less picky.
Timid or Jolly ideally, Hasty or Naive acceptable.s

Route 2
=======

There are plenty of trainers here to help you prepare for the gym.
Try to pick some strong Pokemon to train up.
Hoot-Hoot is a strong pick for flying moves and Keen Eye.
Also, keep in mind that once you clear all the trainers on this
route, the man on the beach will give you a Litleo level 14.
Try to get a Timid one with good speed and special attack.
You can also skip past here with the teleporting man, and head
straight to Dresco Town.
From there you can stock up, check our Route 3, and come back later.

Pokemon Spotlight: Riolu
------------------------
Riolu evolves into the very strong Lucario, but it is hard to find.
The optimium Riolu will be Adamant or Jolly.
The ability will not matter much, because once you can get Mega Lucario it will
have the Adaptibility ability, which is ideal.

Pokemon Spotlight: Litleo
-------------------------
This pokemon is very useful for the first gym.
The first gym is a double battle, and Incinerate hits both enemies.
Try to get one with high Special Attack and Speed.

Dresco Town
===========

Quests:
- Zygard Cells

Trades
- Give an Alolan Sandshrew to receive a Ducklett

Pokemon Spotlight: Ducklett
---------------------------
Ducklett is a cute little guy that is very handy for the first gym.
He comes with Keen Eye and Defog, and Aeriel Ace to boot which all
counters the gym gimmick. Try to get one with high speed and
special attack, where it excels.

Gym 1: Stoner Gym
-----------------
I think this fight is generally easy.
The game gives you a number of options to counter the gym gimmick.
Your starter may know Sandstorm, or you can use the Ducklett to defog.

Route 3
=======

Pokemon Spotlight: Wingull
--------------------------
Don't sleep on Wingull.
If you want to build a Rain team, Wingull/Pelipper is a classic way to do it.
Try to get one with the Hydration ability, which will become Drizzle when
it becomes Pelipper.
Look for Bold nature with high HP and Special Defense.
