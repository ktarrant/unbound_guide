Path to Gym 2
*************

Looking Forward
===============
The first gym is in Crater Town and uses Dark types.
Fighting, Bug, and Fairy are super effective.
Ghost and Dark are not very effective.
Psychic and Ghost are vulnerable.


Grim Woods

Route 4

Pokemon Spotlight: Ralts
------------------------
Ralts can become either Gardevoir or Gallade, both are strong.
However, Gallade is better, so a male is ultimately what you want.
For Gardevoir, look for Timid with Special Attack and Speed.
For Gallade, look for Jolly with Attack and Speed.
Ralts is also your first opportunity to get a Pokemon with
Synchronize, which can allow you to manipulate what Nature the
Pokemon you catch and receive as gifts has.
However, for farming sync Pokemon, Ralts is too rare to be useful at
this point in the game.
One you get the DexNav it is easier, by Abra is a better choice as
your Sync pokemon.

Route 5
=======

I like to progress through this to Crater Town as fast as possible,
and come back to get the trainers and items I missed.
There are some useful things in Crater Town that you'll want
while you are training.

Free Unova Starter
------------------
A woman will give you a free Unova starter.
Tepig is considered the weakest of the three.
Piplup ends up gaining a Steel type, which can be strong,
but the stats and moveset don't align with the Steel type
very well.
Snivy can end up crazy strong.
If you hunt for the Hidden Ability "Contrary",
it synergizes with Leaf Storm learned at level 62,
creating a Lead Storm spamming monster.
For Snivy, look for Timid, prioritizing HP and Speed.

Pokemon Day Care
----------------
Pokemon breeding is a path to getting a Pokemon with the perfect
Nature, IVs, and ability that you want. It gets complicated, but
now you can start doing it.
Nature, IVs, abilities, and egg moves are all inherited from the
parents, so you still need to start with good Pokemon to really
reap the benefits.
Once you get the DexNav, your options really open up.

Crater Town
===========

KBT Expressway
--------------
You now have access to KBT Expressway.
Here you can do mining to get Everstones and other stones, Gems, Bottle Caps and other things.
At this stage, the Everstones are very useful for upgrading Macho Brace.

Macho Band Upgrade
------------------
This is where you can upgrade your Macho Brace.
It starts at Level 2, i.e. 2x EV when held.
Each level costs it's value in Everstones.
As in, Level 3 costs 3 Everstones.
The max level is level 10.
This is very valuable, as EV training becomes essential.
You can go to the Trainer House, battle the relevant
EV trainer, and gain 10 EVs per Pokemon fought.
Since it is typically three per battle, that means
you can get 30 per battle, and max out a category in
9 fights. In comparison, at level 4 it would take 64 fights.

Raising Pokemon
---------------
Around now, you should be able to get to 50 caught Pokemon with
some work, which will let you get the Stat Scanner.
With you upgrades to Macho Brace, you can start to meaningfully
EV train.

Hidden Clefairy
---------------
Behind the bookshelf
Bold - HP/Def - Magic Guard (2nd ability)
