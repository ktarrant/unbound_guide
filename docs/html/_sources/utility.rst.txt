Utility Pokemon
===================================

Synchronize
---------------------------
Synchronize ability sets the encountered Pokemon's ability to match the Sync Pokemon.
Sync also works on pokemon received as gifts or at the casino!
The easiest Sync Pokemon is Abra.

CompoundEyes and Thief
----------------------
CompoundEyes is an ability that increases the chance that wild Pokemon are holding items.
Combined with Thief, you can more easily farm held items from wild Pokemon.
Venonat is a good early option to get both, Scatterbug is also an option.

Flame body
----------
Having a Pokemon with Flame Body in your party makes eggs hatch faster.
I have been using Magmar.

Arena Trap and Mean Look
------------------------
I have been using Jynx for Mean Look.

False Swipe
-----------
Can lower a Pokemon's HP to 1 without killing it.
I have used Gligar for this. Sneasel is also an option.
