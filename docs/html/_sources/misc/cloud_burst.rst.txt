Cloud Burst
===================================

The secret to Cloud Burst is the green balls.
Each green ball doubles your current score,
and provides a buff for a short time.
While the buff is active your speed is increased
and any additional balloons you hit will score double.

The game spawns a map of different types of balls,
and potentially a green score multiplier ball.

The strategy is to collect some high-score balloons first,
then collect the first green ball.

Once you have captured the existing green ball and finished
your buff, it is possible a new green ball will spawn.

If you collect two green balls should be able to
consistently get at least 200 coins.
With only one green ball, you can usually get 100 coins.

Also keep in mind that if you hit the edge, the game will
do an about face for you.
This is useful if you score a target near the edge and want
to quickly reorient yourself towards the middle.
