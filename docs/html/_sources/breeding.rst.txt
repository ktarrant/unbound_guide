Breeding Basics
===============
- Pick two species with matching Egg Groups
- There are three broad categories:
    - Gendered Breeding
    - Genderless Breeding
    - Ditto Breeding
- "Baby Pokemon" cannot breed until evolved
- The Nature is random, unless an Everstone is used
- IV Inheritance
    - 5 Random and 1 inherited, unless you have Destiny Knot
    - With Destiny Knot, 5 inherited 1 Random
    - Don't get Destiny Knot until Seaport Town
