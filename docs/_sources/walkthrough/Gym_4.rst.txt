Path to Gym 4
*************

Looking Forward
===============
The next gym is in Fallshore City and it is the Normal-type Gym.
However, it's gimmick is that it is an Inverse battle area, so
all type matchups are reversed.
A non-Ghost type Pokemon with a Ghost-type move is the best way
to get a Super Effective hit.
Slowing down the enemy, poisoning them, and hitting them with Hex
is a good bet.
Nidoqueen and Crobat are great candidates for using Hex.


KBT Expressway
==============
You can take the KBT Expressway from Blizzard City.
If you go back to Crater Town, you can take the KBT
Expressway south and then use Rock Smash to reach
Fallshore City.

Fallshore City
==============
- Hidden Power TM
- Togepi Egg

Route 10
========
- False Swipe TM

.. include:: /routes/Route_10_pokemon.rst

Tehl Town
=========
- Secret Passage

Gym 4: Inverse Battle
=====================
I had a lot of trouble with this gym.
Ultimately I built a super cheesy composition built
around Sticky Web, Toxic Spikes, and Hex.
Ribombee - Sticky Web (egg move)
Crobat - Toxic / Hex / Air Cutter / Venoshock
Nidoqueen (x2) - Toxic Spikes / Hex / Venoshock / Toxic
Torkoal - For healing the others.
